# MealPlan [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chiraggupta/MealPlan.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chiraggupta/MealPlan)

MealPlan is an iOS app that we use at home for planning our meals every week.

## Goals
- Only support the minimal set of features based on our usage.
- Showcase it as a properly unit tested Swift app based on the Model-View-Presenter (MVP) pattern.
